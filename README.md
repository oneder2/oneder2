## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**oneder2/oneder2** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: My personal project about "the best workspace ever".
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: More skill about web dev based on python, especially flask and PostgreSQL(which is granted as the best SQL language ever, I will figure it out)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Ride-on-Race, which is a platformer game based on unity engine. Just a side mission though.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: My own game project Nine-Days. This will be a tough work, and I intend to finish the demo of it during this summer vacation(apporximate before Sept 1st 2025), and now I deadly need 2D game designers.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: In fact there do not really think there is anything I could been asked :( But I am sure I will learn plenty of things from people here :)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Main email address: gellar@tutatnota.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: The digit(10-base) sum of my birthday, my father's birthday, my grandfather's birthday all equals to 10.
