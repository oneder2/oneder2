## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**oneder2/oneder2** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: My project about "the best workspace ever".
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: More skills about web dev based on Python, especially Flask and PostgreSQL(which is granted as the best SQL language ever, I will figure it out)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m currently collaborating on: Ride-on-Race, which is a platformer game based on the Unity engine. Just a side mission though.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my game project, Nine-Days. This will be tough work, and I intend to complete the demo during this summer vacation (approximately before September 1st, 2025). I now urgently need 2D game designers.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: In fact, I do not think there is anything I could have been asked :( But I am sure I will learn plenty of things from people here :)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Main email address: gellar@tutatnota.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: The digit(10-base) sum of my birthday, my father's birthday, and my grandfather's birthday all equals 10.
